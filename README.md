# UISegmentedControl Example

The following project is an XCode project showing `UISegmentedControl` being programmatically added.
This is a simple project which I hope can help those learning iOS programming gain some insight when
building views.

You can find my tutorial with this project [here][tutorial]. Understand that this is for those
just learning as I made this while I was learning iOS and started exploring the Segment Control
and how to add it programmatically rather than through the interface builder. I feel, I learned more
about the control flow and it was a good experience when running through the Apple Docs.
